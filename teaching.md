<h3>University of Texas at Austin Courses</h3>

<b>COE 332 - Software Engineering and Design -</b> 
CIC has designed and taught a course that is part of the new 
<a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/undergraduate/computational-undergrad-program"> Computational
Engineering</a> degree program at the University of Texas at Austin.

<ul>
  <li><i>Description:</i> Restricted to computational engineering majors. 
Covers methods and tools for planning, designing, implementing, validating 
and maintaining large software systems. May include project work to 
build a software system as a team, using appropriate software engineering tools and 
techniques. Prerequisite: Computational Engineering 322 with a grade of at least C-.

<h3>Professional Training</h3>
CIC designs and delivers professional workshops at national conferences
and regional meetings, covering distributed computing topics including,
containers, APIs, functions-as-a-service, and data analysis. 

<h4>Past Trainings</h4>
Where possible, training resources are made available online.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tacc.github.io/gateways19-hpc-in-the-cloud/">Gateways 19: HPC in the Cloud</a> - This course 
  provides a basic introduction to 
  Docker and Container technologies, Event-driven, serverless computing with Abaco, 
  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Tapis APIs, and how to automate a basic 
  HPC workflow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gateways2019.sched.com/event/RaK6">Creating Science Gateways with Genapp, Containers and Abaco</a> - This 
  tutorial builds upon the Gateways 2016 and Gateways 2018 tutorials. 
  (The Gateways 2016 tutorial is available on-line, genapp.rocks/learn). The first 
  90-minute session is a repeat of that provided in the Gateways 2018 tutorial. 
  The second 90 minute session contains all new material.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tacc.github.io/pearc19-hpc-in-the-cloud/">Portable, Reproducible High Performance Computing In the Cloud - PEARC19</a> -  This 
  tutorial provides an introduction to: Jupyter & Docker, Tapis & its Command Line 
  Interface (CLI), Abaco, Singularity, Tapis Systems, and Tapis Apps.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tapis-project.github.io/uh-hpc-in-the-cloud/">UH Workshop on Reproducible Science in the Cloud</a> - This 
  tutorial was a previous version of our Cloud/HPC wokshop delivered at the beautiful University of Hawaii Manoa. It provides an 
  introduction to Jupyter & Docker, Tapis & its Command Line Interface (CLI), Abaco, Singularity, Tapis Systems, and Tapis Apps. </li>
